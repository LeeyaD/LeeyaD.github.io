							<h2 class="other-projects">About Me</h2>
								<h4>I’m a software engineer excited to bring my integrity-centered professionalism, communication skills, and curiosity to my next opportunity.</h4>
								<br/>
								<h4>I enjoy problem-solving, and I opt for a structured approach because I recognize the importance of understanding the problem I’m trying to solve first. I’ve learned that a well-thought-out algorithm is better than writing a premature solution based on assumptions made at a glance.</h4>
								<br/>
								<h4>I have a strong command of Ruby and JavaScript, as well as a deep understanding of programming concepts. This solid background allows me to ramp up on new technologies quickly, much like a polyglot learning their 3rd or 4th language.</h4>
								<br/>
								<h4>I recently concluded a stint leading a women’s programming group, which I did for 1.5 years. During that time, I honed my leadership skills as I collaborated with my co-lead in designing an engaging program. Among our standout events was a Women in Tech Panel with three industry professionals from Mozilla and Gatsby.</h4>
								<br/>
								<h4>I’ve had the opportunity to grow my interpersonal skills with each new personality I’ve worked with, including during my tenure as a team member, then supervisor, with the City of New York, and during the two years I lived and worked in Korea. <div class="tooltip"><span class="tooltiptext">I'm still learning and enjoy practicing Korean!</span>한국어를 아직도 배우고 있고 즐겁게 연습해요!</div> I’m also an avid reader of literature on conflict resolution, and I love sharing ideas on the topic.</h4>
								<br/>
								<h4>As a former licensed massage therapist turned civil servant turned software engineer, I view new experiences as adventures. Meeting new people, learning new things, and facing new challenges are invaluable to personal and professional development.</h4>
